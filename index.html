            <h2>My name is Violet Tran</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="highlight-personal">A high school student</span> with a strong interest in <span class="highlight-hobby">politics</span>, <span class="highlight-hobby">history</span>, <span class="highlight-hobby">languages</span>, and <span class="highlight-hobby">coding</span>. 
                I'm currently expanding my <span class="highlight-other">German language skills</span> and dedicating my free time to various creative projects and schoolwork. 
                <span class="highlight-personal">My heritage</span> includes being half <span class="highlight-personal">Vietnamese</span> and half <span class="highlight-personal">Trinidadian</span>, which enriches my perspective and experiences. 
                I currently live in the vibrant city of <span class="highlight-other">New York</span>, where I actively pursue my passions and strive to make meaningful contributions. 
                <span class="highlight-other">My passion for languages and cultures</span> has inspired me to explore different countries and form new friendships, constantly broadening my horizons. 
                As a student, I’m deeply engaged in both academics and extracurricular activities, always looking to push boundaries and challenge myself. 
                Whether it’s through <span class="highlight-hobby">coding new projects</span> or <span class="highlight-other">learning about global issues</span>, I aim to grow and make a positive impact on the world around me.
